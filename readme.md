# Access Control Lists Implementation using Solidity

This Repository contains the code that implements the ACL functionality that is written using the Solidity programming language for Ethereum. These are smart contracts that can be used to enforce the security aspects within any other smart contract. The contracts here written so that they can be used to intercept the functions and inject the ACL logic into the business functionaly.

## Category
Non-Functional Requirements for enforcing security in Ethereum via Smart Contracts.

## Repository Status

This is a WIP and I will keep updating the code as I progress. This version is an initial commit and the full blown app / sample will be integrated as development completes.

In case of any questions / queries, please communicate via issues
